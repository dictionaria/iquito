They made their appearance in Iquito territory during the Rubber Boom, and gained control over the Iquito people at about the beginning of the 20th century, exploiting them so mercilessly that their descendants regularly refer to that period as one of ‘slavery’. Control via violence and physical indimidation gave way to debt peonage in the 1920s and 1930s, with the ‘patrones’ having gained hegemony over the Iquitos with the effective support of the local state and church. The power of the ‘patrones’ began to wane in the 1950s, as more Iquitos came to have knowledge of mainstream Peruvian society, and from the 1960s on, gained access to education. By the 1980s the ‘patrones’ had lost most of the power they once held. The ‘patrón’ under whom the Iquitos founded the community of San Antonio was Ramón Ampuero, but after his accidental death, his territory was taken over by a neighboring ‘patrón’, Elías Guimack, who subsequently exercised a considerable influence over the Iquito people, together with his son, Eluterio Guimack, who assumed the role of ‘patrón’ when his father became older.

Its trunk reaches some 75cm in diameter and has many branches, starting fairly low on the trunk, and its bark was used for a black, varnish-like paint that served to beautify and preserve items like paddles and gourd vessels that frequently got wet. The varnishing process involved finely grinding the bark of this tree, mixing it with water, and straining the resulting mixture strained to obtain a somewhat viscous reddish liquid. This liquid was applied in multiple coats to the object, with each coat being allowed to dry thoroughly. Next, a hole was dug for the object, ash was placed in the bottom, and the object itself was placed above the ash, supported by horizontal support sticks. In the final step, urine was added to the ashes, and the hole was covered with leaves to create a good seal.

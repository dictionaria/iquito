The language and its speakers
-----------------------------

Iquito [iqu] is a language of the Zaparoan family; its sister languages include Andoa [anb] (also: Katsakáti), Arabela [arl], and Záparo [zro] (also: Zápara, Sápara).<a href="#ref1" id="1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Omurano [omu] and Abishira [avs] have been classified as Zaparoan in some sources (e.g., Kaufman 1994), but because they exhibit no systematic similarities to Zaparoan languages, or to each other, they are most likely isolates (Michael et al., in prep.)."><sup>1</sup></a> Both Iquito and the Zaparoan family are critically endangered. At the time of writing in 2020, Iquito has fewer than 10 remaining fluent native speakers, the youngest of whom are in their seventies and only two of whom regularly use the language as a means of communication. As of 2011, Arabela had about 30 remaining speakers (Buenaño 2011); as of 2014, Záparo had only a few rememberers; and by 2009 Andoa had already fallen silent.<a href="#ref2" id="2" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Information on Andoa and Záparo language vitality is based on language documentation fieldwork by the compilers in the relevant communities (see Michael et al. 2009 and Beier et al. 2014 respectively)."><sup>2</sup></a> Community-oriented efforts to revitalize and revalorize Iquito (Beier & Michael 2018) and Záparo (e.g., Viatori & Ushigua 2007) are currently underway, however.

Prior to encountering European diseases, missionaries, and military aggression in the late 17th century, speakers of the Zaparoan languages occupied an extensive territory in what is now northeastern Peru and eastern Ecuador. This territory spanned from the banks of the Napo River in the north to the banks of the middle Tigre River in the south and to the upper Pastaza River basin in the west (Map 1). Within this region, Iquito groups occupied a large territory between the Napo and Tigre Rivers. Iquitos’ first major sustained interaction with the invading Europeans and their descendants was with Jesuit missionaries in the 18th century, who sought to concentrate Iquitos in a number of *reducciones*, or mission settlements, in the Nanay River basin (see Map 2). After the Jesuits were expelled from South America, some Iquito  families settled near the present day location of the city of Iquitos (Grohs 1974, Uriarte 1986), through which circumstance the city later got its name.

After a period of relative peace and liberty, Iquitos were again beset during the Rubber Boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the remaining Iquito groups were enslaved by the so-called *patrones* who controlled the local rubber trade (Santos-Granero & Barclay 2000). Through the triple impact of introduced diseases, missionization, and enslavement, an original Iquito population of roughly 5,000 was reduced to some 150 individuals by the 1920s. Yet, despite such staggering population loss, the Iquito language and many aspects of culture remained vital until the 1950s, when the combination of virulent local anti-indigenous racism and Peruvian government policies designed to ‘peruvianize’ indigenous peoples (de la Cadena 2000) — notably including aggressively anti-indigenous education policies — brought an abrupt end to natural language transmission from young parents to their children. Since the late 1950s, the number of Iquito speakers has dropped increasingly sharply, as the Iquito language has been replaced by Loretano Spanish [spq], a regional variety of Peruvian Spanish.

Since the 1950s, the majority of Iquito speakers and inheritors have lived in or near the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu (Map 2).

The first Iquito school was a bilingual school founded in San Antonio in approximately 1958 by a North American Protestant missionary couple, Robert and Elizabeth Eastman, of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International; SIL below), who trained and supported the school’s only fluent bilingual Iquito/Spanish teacher, Felix Cabral Sinchija, until conflicts with the regional government and the Catholic Church led to the closing of Felix Cabral’s bilingual school in 1967. Subsequently, the Peruvian Ministry of Education provided Spanish-language-only formal education until 1999, when the school in San Antonio was converted to an ‘intercultural bilingual’ school (*Educación Intercultural Bilingüe*), a model of education that allows indigenous community members who have a high school diploma to obtain teaching positions in indigenous community schools with the stated objective of facilitating the transmission of Indigenous languages and cultures within the formal education system.

The Iquito Language Documentation Project (ILDP), of which this dictionary is an outcome, was launched in San Antonio in 2001 in response to an effort by community elders and leaders to increase the presence of Iquito language and culture in community life. The objectives of the ILDP, which were laid out in a formal agreement among its participants in 2002, were to create linguistic documentation of Iquito coupled with language revitalization materials and activities. Two intensive phases of collaborative work among members of the ILDP team have taken place: in 2002–2006 and from 2014 to the time of writing. Please see the <a href="#section24">Acknowledgements</a> for information on funding for the ILDP.

Sources of the data for this dictionary
---------------------------------------

This dictionary is based on the knowledge of this resource’s four fluent native Iquito speaker <a href="#section24">co-authors</a>. Lexical documentation of Iquito was an integral part of the ILDP since its inception, and formed an important part of fieldwork every year from 2002 to 2006 and again from 2014 through 2020.

The lexical documentation of Iquito reflected in this dictionary involved three methods that we describe below: text analysis, spontaneous interaction, and elicitation.

### Text analysis

Many lexical items were identified from the transcription of audio recordings of monological texts, such as personal narratives, historical narratives, traditional stories, and procedural texts, as well as from audio recordings of spontaneous multi-party interactions among Iquito speakers. Such texts not only served to identify lexical items but also served to complement our elicitation-based understanding of their meanings.

In addition, transcribed and translated audio-recorded texts were the source of the majority of the example sentences provided in the lexical entries. Example sentences drawn from texts were checked during elicitation sessions for their accuracy and grammaticality.

### Spontaneous interaction

In their work with the Iquito language, compilers Beier and Michael included a strong commitment to developing as much communicative competence in the language as possible. As a result, through conversations among the six co-authors of this dictionary, a sizable number of new lexical items, and new senses of previously documented lexical items, were identified.

### Elicitation

Finally, elicitation played a crucial role. Many lexical items were identified in the context of elicitation sessions that explored particular semantic domains, some of which made use of visual and audio stimulus materials (see <a href="#section21">Scientific names</a> for further discussion), as well as co-participation in daily activities. Elicitation was critical in the development of definitions, and systematic comparison among headwords with similar meanings played an especially important role.

Each field of each entry was systematically checked in structured elicitation sessions by Beier and/or Michael with one or more of our co-authors. The form of the headword and the definition were checked with a minimum of two of our co-authors, and many were checked with three or all four of them.

Example sentences that were not obtained from transcribed texts were obtained via elicitation by Beier or Michael and a native speaker.

Finally, the lexical database underlying this dictionary was first developed in Shoebox and later imported into, and further developed with, [Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx)](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/).

How this dictionary came about and what comes next
--------------------------------------------------

The preparation of a reasonably comprehensive dictionary of a previously little-documented language is a long voyage, and here we briefly describe the course that has brought about the work before you, and the future trajectory we anticipate.

The compilers’ engagement with the Iquito language began in 2001, when we made our first visit to the Iquito community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu, in response to reports from NGO contacts in Lima and Iquitos that the community was interested in finding linguists to assist them in responding to the endangerment of their heritage language. Community members expressed enthusiasm about the prospect of us undertaking language documentation and revitalization activities with them, and so in 2002 we returned to San Antonio and launched our work with two fellow graduate students, Mark Brown and Lynda de Jong (now Boudreault). Subsequently, we obtained three years of funding, in collaboration with Nora England as PI, from the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Documentation Programme, which supported a team-based language documentation and revitalization project from 2003 through 2006.

From the outset, community members identified an Iquito–Spanish dictionary as one of the most important language documentation priorities, and so, in 2006, at the end of the ELDP-funded phase of the project, we completed the *Diccionario Bilingüe Iquito–Castellano y Castellano–Iquito* (Michael et al. 2006) and distributed this first version of an Iquito dictionary to the community’s bilingual school teachers and other interested community members, as well as making it available online.

After a hiatus during which we were committed to work with other Amazonian languages, we returned to language documentation and revitalization activities with Iquito in 2014, with further development of the dictionary as one of our major goals. Apart from increasing the lexical coverage of the dictionary, we were eager to improve the detail and precision of the definitions, to provide more grammatical information, and to update the phonological representations of citation forms and roots. At that point, we made three important changes.

First, we decided to change the primary language of the entries from Spanish to English and complete the dictionary in English, subsequently translating it as a whole into Spanish. Our motivation for doing this was to increase the precision of the dictionary’s definitions and notes, having recognized that, since we are not native Spanish speakers, the existing Spanish prose of the dictionary was problematic in a number of ways. Although this decision has slowed the pace at which we are able to make new Spanish versions of the dictionary available to community members and hispanophone scholars, we felt that the need for accuracy outweighed the desideratum of speed.

Second, we changed the orthography used in the dictionary to reflect the new Iquito alphabet that the Peruvian Ministry of Education made official in 2014. The 2006 version of the dictionary employed an orthography that followed hispanophone orthographic conventions, and which drew considerably on the orthography developed in the early 1960s by Robert and Elizabeth Eastman, SIL missionaries who worked in the Iquito community of San Antonio for a number of years. In 2002, when we began active work with the Iquito community, community members expressed the desire to continue using this earlier orthography, and so, with minor modifications, we adopted it as the orthography for our work. In 2014, however, Peru’s Ministry of Education conducted a set of community-participatory alphabet workshops which resulted in the official adoption of a new non-hispanophone alphabet. Consequently, in that same year, we adopted this new alphabet and developed an <a href="#section8">orthography</a> based on it, with extensions for phonemes that the Ministry’s alphabet development had not addressed.

And third, we redoubled our commitment to developing an adequate analysis and understanding of the Iquito prosodic system, with one of our major aims being to improve the phonological representations in the dictionary. Iquito exhibits an intricate tonal system in which tones associated with different morphological categories interact in complex ways and, in some cases, are also associated with vowel lengthening processes. Our understanding of the prosodic system at the end of the first phase of the ILDP, being only partial, led to a variety of inaccuracies in the phonological representations in the 2006 dictionary. At this point, we are satisfied that we have a good analysis and understanding of the Iquito prosodic system, which has resulted in much-improved phonological representations in this dictionary. There will inevitably be minor adjustments going forward, but we now feel confident in our overall analysis, conclusions, and representations.

The preceding allusion to the future leads us to observe that if the creation of a dictionary is a lengthy voyage, the publication of the present version is but one waypoint towards the destination of documenting the Iquito lexicon to the best of our abilities, and of providing accessible lexical resources to varied communities interested in them—most obviously, Iquito community members, hispanophone scholars, and anglophone scholars. In August 2019, we released a new student dictionary (Beier et al. 2019) and distributed it to Iquito elders, leaders, and other interested community members, as well as online. This is the first widely-distributed dictionary for use by community members since the 2006 version, and it constitutes the first major output of the research that we resumed in 2014. The *Iquito–English Dictionary* published by Ediciones Abya-Yala in 2019 constituted the second output of that research, and has a scholarly target audience. This searchable online version, based on the 2019 publication, constitutes the third output. At present, we are in the midst of translating this Iquito—English dictionary into an Iquito–Spanish dictionary, which will likewise have a scholarly target audience, and which we hope to publish in the coming year, as the fourth output of our research. As the fifth output, we are preparing a reference dictionary for community use, which will be more extensive and detailed than the student dictionary, which was necessarily tailored for use by school children.

We also intend to prepare a new edition of this Iquito–English dictionary, although we hesitate to predict when it will be ready. We anticipate the value of a new edition for a number of reasons. First, we are currently preparing a descriptive grammar of Iquito, and experience has taught us that advances in our understanding of Iquito grammar often have implications for both our understanding of the Iquito lexicon, and for our judgment of what properly belongs in lexical resources, versus what should be treated in grammatical descriptions. For example, it has only been in recent years that we have come to realize that the word class of nouns includes an important subclass that we call locative nouns (see the discussion of <a href="#section14">nouns</a> below) which merit being identified as such in the part-of-speech specifications of dictionary lemmas. We do not doubt that similar insights, with similar consequences for the documentation of the Iquito lexicon, will emerge as our grammatical research continues. Similarly, there are other areas where recent discoveries suggest that in the future we may need to revise aspects of our lexical documentation. For example, recent research has revealed that a phonological distinction exists among postpositions: some of them condition tonal shifts, a property that we associate with tightly prosodically-bound elements; while others do not, a property that we associate with prosodically independent words. In this dictionary, we treat all postpositions as enclitics, since they are indeed all phrasal enclitics, but it may be the case that in the future we will wish to differentiate between postpositions that behave like phonological clitics, and those that do not.

Second, for reasons of continuity with previous works written on Iquito, by ourselves as well as by others, in this edition we continue to mark only high tones in Iquito forms. However, our research over the past two years has made it clear that Iquito also exhibits low tones, resulting in a three-way tonal contrast on tone-bearing units between high, low, and null. As it turns out, the position of low tones can usually be predicted by the position of high tones (and conversely), so the current representations are not inaccurate *per se* but these representations do suffer from the drawback that determining the position of low tones on the basis of high tones requires an intimate familiarity with the complex Iquito tonal system, which is a heavy burden to place on most dictionary users. The representations in the next edition of the dictionary will mark both high and low tones, making them more surface-transparent.

Third, we are in the midst of significantly revising our substantial text corpus, which exists as a parsed FLEx corpus, and we anticipate that doing so will lead us to expand and revise the dictionary in certain ways. The revision of the text corpus has been motivated both by advances we have made in our understanding of the Iquito prosodic system, as briefly discussed above, and by advances in our understanding of the Iquito lexicon (e.g., distinguishing an increasing number of senses in certain lemmas). Experience tells us that the revision of the text corpus will lead us to refine our understanding of the semantics of certain lexemes, and will also provide us with the opportunity to increase both the quantity and quality of exemplification in the dictionary.

We offer the user of this dictionary, then, the present work, which is as comprehensive a documentation of the lexicon of Iquito as is possible at the present time. Given the richness and intricacy of each human language, the development of any dictionary is a potentially endless journey, with further exemplification, explication, and emendation always possible. Our progress with the documentation of the Iquito lexicon has reached a point, however, that we believe merits the release of new dictionaries for use by the Iquito community and the scholarly community. We hope our readers concur.

*Table 2.* Iquito consonant inventory. Segments in square brackets are surface allophones of the phoneme; graphemes in angle brackets indicate the practical orthography if it differs from the phonemic representation.

In the next section, we discuss the alphabet and the graphemes that we have used to represent segmental phonemes in the Iquito orthography employed in this dictionary; in the subsequent section, we turn to a discussion of the orthographic representation of tone that we employ.

### Segmental graphemes and orthography

The Iquito alphabet used in this dictionary is closely based on the official Iquito alphabet that was developed in a set of community-participatory workshops organized by the Peruvian Ministry of Education in 2014. This alphabet is given, in alphabetical order, in (1):

(1) a, aa, i, ii, ɨ, ɨɨ, j, k, m, n, p, r, s, t, u, uu, w, y

On the basis of this alphabet, we represent the eight vowel phonemes of Iquito using the graphemes given in Table 3 and the fourteen consonant phonemes using the graphemes given in Table 4. In both tables, the ‘phoneme’ column provides IPA-based phonemic equivalents for the graphemes.<a href="#ref6" id="6" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It merits mention that although the official Ministry of Education alphabet is, as the description suggests, an alphabet and not an orthography per se, it is the case that the choice of letters for the official alphabet was significantly guided by an intention to produce an orthography very similar to the one used here. As far as we are aware, though, the Ministry of Education has yet to develop this orthography."><sup>6</sup></a>

*Table 4.* Iquito consonant graphemes

While the vowel graphemes are self-explanatory, a few of the consonant graphemes require some explanation. Specifically, the Iquito orthography used in this dictionary employs a set of digraphs selected to maintain continuity with the Iquito orthography developed by SIL missionaries Robert and Elizabeth Eastman (e.g., Eastman & Eastman 1963; see <a href="#section1">The language and its speakers</a> for more information). These digraphs fall into two classes:

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
three graphemes associated with palatalization, &lt;ki(a), ni(a), si(V)&gt;,
representing the phonemes /kʲ, ɲ, ʃ/ respectively; and
</li>

<li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
the grapheme associated with labialization, &lt;kw&gt;, representing the phoneme /kʷ/.
</li>
</ol>

Beginning with the latter, the phoneme /kʷ/ has a restricted distribution, appearing only before /a, aː/. Despite this restricted distribution, there is no evidence suggesting that it should be analyzed synchronically as an underlying stop-glide sequence; or as the result of glide formation (e.g., from an underlying /kua/ sequence); or as the result of rounding harmony.<a href="#ref7" id="7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Although some speakers do variably realize underlying /uka/ sequences as [uka]&sim;[ukʷa], this is an unrelated phenomenon."><sup>7</sup></a> (Significantly, a labialized voiceless velar stop reconstructs to Proto-Zaparoan; see Michael et al., in prep.)

Turning now to the graphemes associated with palatalization, we begin by observing that there does exist a productive glide-formation process in Iquito, by which the high vowels /i, ɨ, u/ glide to /j/ (&lt;y&gt;) to avoid vowel hiatus, i.e., /CiV/ &rarr; /CʲV/. The productivity of this process is evident in cases where these vowels appear in root-final position and are followed by vowel-initial suffixes, as in (2).

It may well have been the existence of this productive glide-formation process that led the Eastmans to represent the palatalized component of all palatalized segments as an orthographic &lt;i&gt;.<a href="#ref9" id="9" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Interestingly, this was a common feature among orthographies developed by SIL missionaries for indigenous Peruvian Amazonian languages in the 1950s and 1960s. It is unclear, on a language by language basis, and in Iquito in particular, to what degree this choice represents a commitment to the underlying, or phonemic, representation of the speech sounds in question, and to what degree this was simply a general orthographic convenience."><sup>9</sup></a> Thus, instead of adopting distinct graphemes for /kʲ, ɲ, ʃ/, they chose to represent the corresponding speech sounds as &lt;ki(a), ni(a), si(V)&gt;.

And indeed, the glide-formation process mentioned above would yield, from an underlying /CiV/ representation, a surface sequence identical to that derived from the /kʲ/ and /ɲ/ phonemes we posit. Nevertheless, we do not opt to eliminate the /kʲ/ and /ɲ/ phonemes in favor of underlying /kiV/ and /niV/ sequences. This is due to the simple fact that, in forms where we posit such phonemes, there is never an alternation that suggests the presence of an underlying /ki/ or /ni/ sequence, which raises the question of how speakers could ever infer the presence of these hypothetical sequences. Similar observations apply for opting to retain a /ʃ/ phoneme in our inventory.

Finally, in order to maintain continuity with previous Iquito written materials, in this dictionary we continue to use the existing orthographic strategy for representing /kʲ, ɲ, ʃ/ by writing palatalized segments as &lt;CiV&gt; sequences, or &lt;ki(a), ni(a), si(V)&gt; respectively.

### Tone marking and orthography

In addition to segmental phonemes, Iquito exhibits tone, with a tonal inventory of /H, L, Ø/ (high, low, and null). The tonal system is complex, with most tones constituting parts of /HLL/ tonal melodies. In the orthography employed in this dictionary, only /H/ tones are marked, and in general, each /H/ tone is followed by two /L/ tones, although the second /L/ tone is, in some environments, supplanted by an /H/ from a following /HLL/ melody.

Below we exemplify how tone is indicated in this dictionary, with only /H/ tones marked, and how this corresponds to a tonal representation in which /L/ tones are also marked. In (3a), we provide the orthographic representation of ‘blood’ as found in this dictionary; in (3b), we provide the representation in which the entire /HLL/ melody is spelled out, including the two /L/ tones that can be inferred from the presence of the /H/ tone. Likewise, in (4a) we provide the orthographic representation of *‘Tamshi Quebrada’* found in the dictionary, and in (4b), the representation including /L/ tones; in this case, though, note that the first /HLL/ melody is truncated because the /H/ from the second /HLL/ melody falls on the mora that would otherwise have been occupied by the second /L/ of the first /HLL/ melody, i.e., the melody associated with the first /H/ tone.

Structure and content of dictionary entries
-------------------------------------------

In this section, we provide information that will help readers understand the types of categories and information that are used in the dictionary entries, or *lemmas*, as they are also known.

### Iquito parts of speech

In this dictionary, we distinguish the following parts of speech: adjective, adverb, adverbial subordinator, demonstrative, determiner, grammatical clitic, interjection, interrogative, locative demonstrative adverb, locative noun, locative postposition, noun (including compound nouns), numeral, particle, postposition, pronoun (anaphoric, indefinite, person, and relative), proper noun, and verb (copular, existential, intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, and ambitransitive).

Distinctive properties of these parts of speech in Iquito and their representations in this dictionary are the focus of the discussion below.

### The noun and noun phrase

**Nouns** 

The headword given for nouns is the bare root. Two inflectional categories associated with Iquito nouns exhibit some irregularities: **number** and **possession**.

**Irregular plurals.** Iquito exhibits a regular nominal plural suffix, *-ka*, exemplified in (5).

<table class="unstyled">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>(5)</td>
<td><i>iíminaka</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>iímina-ka</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>canoe-PL</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>‘canoes’</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

In addition, however, the language exhibits a large number of irregular plural forms, some involving relatively high-frequency irregular suffixes, such as *-wa*, exemplified in (6), and others involving suffixes that appear on only one or two nouns in the entire lexicon, such as *-yuuri*.

<table class="unstyled">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>(6)</td>
<td><i>nasiwa</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>nasi-wa</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><i>chacra</i>-PL</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>‘<i>chacras</i>’</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

There is also a significant number of plural forms that are either suppletive or exhibit root allomorphy in their plural forms, exemplified in (7).

<table class="unstyled">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>(7)</td>
<td>a.</td>
<td><i>mɨɨsaji</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>‘woman’</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>b.</td>
<td><i>iitimɨra</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>‘women’</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

If a lexeme exhibits an irregular plural form, we provide this form in the *Irregular Plural* field. It is also important to mention that Iquito is in the midst of a leveling of the plural-marking system towards greater use of the regular plural suffix *-ka*. This means that for some nouns, speakers volunteer both an irregular plural form and a regular plural form.<a href="#ref10" id="10" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Indeed, in some cases, the irregular plural form is now considered archaic."><sup>10</sup></a> When this is the case, we supply both the irregular plural form and regular plural form, to indicate that both forms are considered acceptable.

**Irregular possessed forms.** For numerous nouns, the possessed form differs from the unpossessed form in an unpredictable or only partially predictable manner. The most common difference between possessed and unpossessed forms of nouns is a tonal one, with vowel-initial possessed nouns often bearing an /HLL/ tonal melody that is absent in the unpossessed form, as in (8). These alternations are provided in the *Irregular Possessed Form* field.

<table class="unstyled">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>(8)</td>
<td>a.</td>
<td><i>asasana</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>‘food in general’</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>b.</td>
<td><i>Jaime asásana</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>Jaime food.POSS</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>‘Jaime’s food’</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

**Irregular third person possessed forms.** Iquito exhibits a third person possessive proclitic, *nu=*, that typically simply attaches concatenatively to the left edges of nouns, even when doing so would result in vowel hiatus, as in (9). 

<table class="unstyled">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>(9)</td>
<td><i>nu=inɨ́ɨsi</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>3GNL=hammock</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>‘his/her hammock’</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

For certain nouns, however, this vowel hiatus is resolved, either by deleting the vowel of the proclitic, as in (10), or by the coalescence of the proclitic with the initial syllable of the root, resulting in a change in the vowel quality of the root, as in (11). For these nouns, the irregular form is given in the *Variant Form(s)* field after the tag *irregular 3rd person possessed form*.

<table class="unstyled">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>(10)</td>
<td><i>nánaka</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>nu=ánaka</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>3GNL=head</td>

<tr>

<td>‘his/her/its head’</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>(11)</td>
<td><i>nɨ́niija</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>nu=íniija</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>3GNL=fruit.POSS</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>‘its fruit’</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

**Locative nouns**

Locative nouns are a subclass of nominal roots that obligatorily bear one of five locative suffixes, given in Table 5. Locative suffixes may have a number of different meanings, which depend on the reference frame with respect to which they are construed. 

<table class="table table-bordered">

<thead>
<tr>
<th>Suffix</th>
<th>Meaning</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><i>-ku</i></td>
<td>up, upriver, outside</td>

<tr>
<td><i>-ma</i></td>

<td><i>-kúura</i></td>
<td>perpendicular to river, horizontally distal</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>-ki</i></td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>-jina</i></td>
<td>unspecified (default for certain locative stems)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

</table>

*Table 5.* Locative suffixes.

An important difference between locative nouns and non-locative nouns in Iquito is that locative nouns do not require a postposition to license them in non-core argument functions. In this respect, it appears that the locative suffix licenses its associated nominal root in much the same way that a postposition licenses a noun. Locative nouns are thus ‘self-licensing’ in a way that non-locative nouns are not. 

This important difference is illustrated when we compare (12) and (13). In (12), we see the intransitive verb root *iíki-* ‘be located in a place’ accompanied by a non-core argument expressing a location. In (12a), the postposition *=sirikumaji* ‘right next to’ licenses the noun *kusi* ‘pot’. In (12b), however, no postposition appears; instead, the locative suffix *-ma* ‘LOC:down’ serves as the licenser of the nominal root *kuri-* ‘port’. In (13), we see the transitive verb root *mii-* ‘have’ followed by a direct object core argument. In (13a), the noun *kusi* ‘pot’ is the direct object licensed by the verb *mii-* ‘have’ and it does not appear with a postposition. If we compare (13b) with (13a), we see that when *kuri-* ‘port’, appears as the direct object of the same transitive verb *mii-* ‘have’ it again bears the locative suffix *-ma* ‘LOC:down’ in this core argument function, even though the locative suffix is not required here for its licensing function. Finally, we see in (13c) that it is in fact ungrammatical for a locative nominal root such as *kuri-* ‘port’ to appear without a locative suffix.

<td colspan="2">Target: ‘She/he/it has a port.’</td>

</tbody>
</table>

Note that most locative nouns exhibit a ‘default’ form that is usually construed as being bleached of locative meaning despite bearing a locative suffix, as exemplifed by *kurima* ‘port’ in (13b), where the root *kuri-* bears the locative suffix *-ma* by default. It is the default form that serves as the citation form in this dictionary.

**Morphological expression of number and animacy** 

Number and animacy are marked in noun phrases via a set of three suffixes:  *-na* ‘general number, general animacy’; *-mi* ‘plural inanimate’; and *-pɨ* ‘plural animate’. As is common in such systems cross-linguistically, ‘plural’ stipulates ‘more than one’, while ‘general number’ is simply unspecified for number, compatible with both ‘one’ and ‘more than one’ interpretations. Similarly, ‘general animacy’ is unspecified for animacy, and is compatible with both ‘animate’ and ‘inanimate’ interpretations. Agreement patterns involving these suffixes are described and exemplified below.

**Determiners**

Iquito has a relatively large set of **determiners** — specifically, adnominal elements that establish the ‘givenness’ of the nominal element they accompany — that express both a three-way contrast in number and animacy, discussed in the previous section, and a three-way contrast in spatial reference. The set of determiners is given in Table 6.

*Table 6.* Iquito determiners

Iquito determiners agree in number and animacy with their co-occurring adjectives and nouns. Exhaustive morphological marking of plurality, as in (14a), is common. However, because ‘general’ number and animacy are semantically compatible with either singular or plural referents, as well as with either animate or inanimate ones, non-canonical morphological marking often occurs, in two ways. First, it is possible for any one of the three number/animacy markers to occur on a target determiner (or other adnominal) whose controller lacks overt plural marking, as in (14b&c). Second, ‘generalʼ *-na* may co-occur with either plural, *-mi* or *-pɨ*, as in (14c), depending on discourse context.

Note that the forms *iina, iimi* and *iipɨ* in fact have multiple functions in addition to their role as determiners. They may have an anaphoric function, establishing co-reference with another nominal element in the discourse; and/or they may have a demonstrative (exophoric) function, establishing ostensive reference with an entity in the discourse context, as shown in (15). Finally, they may function as relative pronouns, as in (16).

In addition to the above complex forms, Iquito has a single **indefinite determiner**, shown in (17), whose function is to introduce a new referent into discouse. Note that this form is homophonous with the numeral ‘one’.

**Adjectives**

The citation form of adjectives typically consists of the adjectival root plus the general number and general animacy agreement suffix *-na*, as in (18).

</tbody>
</table>

In some cases, the citation form of an adjective bears not the general number and animacy suffix *-na* form but rather a different suffix that speakers prefer for the citation form for the root in question, as illustrated in (19), where the citation form bears the proximal locative suffix *-ki*.

</tbody>
</table>

**Verbs**

The citation form of verbs is the event-nominalized form of the verb, which Iquito speakers characterize as the ‘name’ of verbs, and which they readily provide when asked to translate the infinitive form of Spanish verbs (e.g., *comer* ‘eat’). The event nominalizer has the segmental form *-ni*, it conditions a preceding long vowel, and it is associated with an /HLL/ melody, with the /H/ tone that we mark in this dictionary appearing two moras to the left of the *-ni* segmental sequence, as in (20) and (21).

<table class="unstyled">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>(20)</td>
<td><i>natáani</i></td>

<tr>

<tr>

<tr>
<td></td><td></td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

While the event-nominalized form of the verb is the obvious choice for the verbal citation form, verb roots cannot in fact be reliably inferred from this citation form, since event nominalization neutralizes length contrasts in the final vowel of the root. For this reason, we also provide the *Root* associated with the citation form in each verb lemma.

Identifying roots is also useful because they may exhibit tones that are erased by the event nominalization process, in particular, when the root’s high tone falls on the mora immediately preceding the event nominalizer’s high tone. Consider, for example, the root *tásii* ‘pinch’, in (22), which forms a minimal pair with *tasii* ‘wait’, given above in (21). As is evident by comparing (22) with (21), the event nominalized forms of *tásii* ‘pinch’ and *tasii* ‘wait’ are homophonous, due to the fact that the root tone of *tásii* ‘pinch’ has been erased by the event nominalization process.

</tbody>
</table>

In addition to providing a verb *Root* for all verb lemmas, we provide a *Derivational Root* (i.e., a root allomorph conditioned by the presence of derivational suffixes) for the 90 or so roots that exhibit them. For example, when followed only by inflectional morphology, the verb *ajirɨ́ɨni* ‘sit’ exhibits the root *ajiítɨ*, but when it is followed by derivational morphology, it exhibits the ‘derivational root’ *ajírɨ*, as in (23), where the derivational root is conditioned by the following event nominalization suffix.

### The Iquito verb and verb phrase

**Transitivity in verbs**

Iquito verbs may be intransitive, transitive, ditransitive or ambitransitive. We briefly distinguish the properties of each below. Note that in this dictionary, identical verb roots of different valencies are given distinct lemmas. Consequently, the transitive and ambitransitive forms of, for example, *asáani* ‘eat’ appear in separate lemmas.

Intransitive verbs are those that license a single subject argument only, as in (24) and (25).

Ditransitive verbs license up to three overt arguments -- subject, direct object, and indirect object -- as exemplified in (30) and (31). While the majority require at least two overt arguments (subject and direct object), a small subset of ditransitive verbs, such as *paajúuni* ‘teach’ require only a single (subject) argument, as in (30a). When a single post-verbal, non-subject argument accompanies a ditransitive verb, ambiguity regarding the grammatical relationship of that argument may arise, as in (31a). When there are two overt post-verbal arguments, their order is not syntactically rigid, as shown in (31b-c); rather, post-verbal argument ordering is sensitive to pragmatic considerations.

**Tense, aspect, and associated motion**

Tense and aspect marking are obligatory on finite Iquito verbs. All tense and aspect categories are expressed via verbal suffixes.

Iquito exhibits a three-way overt **tense** distinction, between *non-past*, *recent past*, and *remote past*. All finite Iquito verbs are also marked for **aspect**, expressing a binary contrast between perfective and imperfective. The expression of perfective aspect is particularly complex, as the language exhibits perfectives that select for lexical aspectual properties of the verb stems to which they attach (and also pragmatically coerce these lexical aspectual properties), as well as a set of **associated motion** suffixes that cumulatively express perfective aspect. Aspect morphology immediately follows the verb stem, with tense morphology to its right. The two remote past tense morphemes additionally cumulatively express a contrast between imperfective and perfective aspect. All these categories and their corresponding surface morphology are given in Tables 8, 9, and 10, while Table 7 provides a summary of the conventions employed in those tables.

**Reality status**

Iquito exhibits an obligatory binary contrast in reality status between ‘realis’ and ‘irrealis’ in finite clauses, where reality status is a grammatical category that is grounded in a distinction between realized eventualities (e.g., events that have taken place in the past) and unrealized eventualities, (e.g., future events and hypothetical states of affairs). In Iquito, irrealis status is associated with future temporal reference, counterfactual modality, optative mood, and desiderative complements (see Beier et al. 2011 for an extensive discussion).

In Iquito, reality status is expressed by a word order alternation, in which two constructions are distinguished by the position of a non-subject, immediately post-verbal phrasal constituent (X) relative to the subject (S) and the verb (V). That is to say, for a given realis construction of the form SVX, there is a corresponding irrealis construction of the form SXV. The intervening X element is relatively unrestricted in terms of constituent type. This constructional alternation, here expressing a contrast between past and future temporal reference, is exemplified in (32) and (33).

**Clause-linking stategies**

While Iquito demonstrates a wide range of semantic distinctions in its clause-linking strategies, the syntactic strategies for clause linking are few in number (see Michael 2009 for an extensive discussion). Here we briefly discuss and exemplify the two main strategies, the first of which employs a free clause-initial syntactic element to link two fully inflected clauses; and the second of which links a fully inflected main clause with a following non-finite clause in the form of a nominalized verb plus a postpositional clitic.

**Linking two finite clauses.** The first clause-linking strategy links two finite clauses using one of a small set of *adverbial subordinators*. The free syntactic element appears at the left edge of the subordinated clause and the subordinated clause typically appears after the main clause, as shown in (34). If the subordinated clause appears before the main clause to which it is linked, then the subordinated clause often optionally bears the clause-final clitic *=na*, as in (35).

**Linking a finite clause and a non-finite clause.** The second clause-linking strategy links a finite clause to a non-finite subordinated clause (most often a ‘reason’ or ‘purpose’ clause) that follows it. The verb of the non-finite clause appears in the ‘event nominalized’ form and is accompanied by a postposition, as in (36) and (37).

### Postpositions

Iquito exhibits a set of about 60 postpositions, all of which are NP enclitics, as exemplified in (38).

</tbody>
</table>

**Locative postpositions**

A subset of Iquito postpositions are morphologially complex elements that include spatial semantics. They obligatorily bear the same locative suffixes borne by locative nouns, as in (39). Like locative nouns, most locative postpositions exhibit a ‘default’ form, which serves as its citation form; the root consists of the citation form stripped of its locative suffix.

### Adverbs

Like most languages, Iquito has a large number of adverbs that have either clausal or verb phrasal scope and whose function is to provide information regarding manner, time, place, degree, or other characteristics of the eventuality associated with the verb or clause. In this section, we focus on morphologically complex adverbs in Iquito that include spatial semantics.

**Locative demonstrative adverbs**

In addition to locative nouns and locative postpositions, Iquito has a closed class of locative demonstrative adverbs. These locative demonstrative adverbs include both a *deictic* component, by which their reference is interpreted relative to speaker; and a *spatial* component, which provides information that anchors the deictic component to features of the spatial configuration of the situation in which the utterance occurs, as exemplified in (40).

### Complex headwords

Headwords in this dictionary include compounds — that is, *noun noun*, *noun adjective*, *adverb verb*, etc. sequences that are presented as a single headword. In the specific case of compound nouns, these are often terms that denote unique flora, fauna, or natural phenomena.

We write compounds as two or more distinct words since the words in the compound are prosodically distinct, as revealed, e.g., by the tonal melodies of each component of the compound.

The most common types of compound forms in Iquito are exemplified in Table 11.

### Other key fields used in this dictionary

**Loanwords**

Those consultants who have most actively used Iquito throughout their adult life, and who, probably not coincidentally, exhibit the least purist language ideologies, liberally employ loanwords from Spanish, and to a lesser degree, Quechua, to refer to a wide range of introduced items and concepts with which Iquito speakers became familiar over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Ideologies of language purism are strong among some Iquito speakers, however, as well as among some other Iquito community members, and these individuals often react negatively to the appearance of identifiable loanwords in spoken Iquito, and even more so in written materials.

In acknowledgement of these concerns about the use of loanwords, we have been conservative in the number of loanwords we have included in the dictionary. Our decisions about which loanwords to include are based on a number of criteria: 1) they are clearly not ‘nonce loans’, but are rather long-established loans; 2) there is no conventionalized and widely-used non-loan Iquito counterpart; and 3) they are frequent even in the speech of relatively purist speakers.<a href="#ref12" id="12" data-toggle="tooltip" title="That is to say, frequent in the speech of these speakers when they are not closely monitoring their own speech for the use of loanwords. When these speakers are being especially vigilant, they tend to substitute either nonce Iquito neologisms or employ periphrasis to avoid the use of the loanword."><sup>12</sup></a>

Moreover, we have sought to include loans that yield some insight into the linguistic or social history of the Iquito people. For example, the use of native Iquito words versus loanwords within the set of cultigens known to modern Iquitos gives us insight into what cultigens were raised by Iquitos prior to intense contact with mestizos in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and which were introduced as a result of that contact. Similarly, the set of animals, fish, and plants with native Iquito names, versus names borrowed from Spanish or other indigenous languages, yields clues regarding the traditional habitat in which the Iquito people lived (that is to say, in headwaters regions, away from large rivers).

**Grammar notes**

We provide grammar notes to clarify the properties of lexemes that exhibit distinguishing or unexpected grammatical properties. In general, grammar notes are prose descriptions of the relevant grammatical properties; here we wish to briefly clarify the meaning of the grammar note abbreviated as **Poss.pref**. This notation indicates that the lexeme belongs to a class of nouns in Iquito that speakers strongly prefer to employ in possessed form, what we call ‘preferably possessed’ nouns. It is important to point out that these are neither obligatorily possessed nouns nor inalienably possessed nouns in an alienable/inalienable possession system, in that it is grammatical for these nouns to appear without possessors. And while in ‘out of the blue’ contexts speakers naturally produce preferably possessed nouns as possessed nouns, suitable contexts (e.g., encountering a dismembered body part) can pragmatically license these nouns to appear in unpossessed form.

**Example sentences**

We provide example sentences in order to clarify the use of lexemes or to exemplify their grammatical properties. Most examples in this dictionary are drawn from recorded texts, but some were elicited to illustrate specific aspects of a lexeme’s meaning or function.

The example sentences follow the orthographic conventions for written Iquito developed by the *Centro del Idioma Iquito*, located in the Iquito community San Antonio de Pintuyacu. The one convention that merits comment here is that clitics are separated from their hosts by equals signs, as in (41):

### Variation and variants

The lexical data gathered by the Iquito Language Documentation Project exhibits a great deal of variation, reflecting the complex dialectal and demographic history of the Iquito people. Here, we discuss the ways in which this dictionary addresses this complex variation.

There are at least two clear sources of variation in the Iquito lexicon. First, as of the late 19th century, the Iquito people consisted of four major geographically delimited sub-groups, enumerated in Table 12 with their corresponding territories. Our consultants’ comments make it clear that, at least in the 20th century, Iquitos held strong language ideologies regarding linguistic differences between these sub-groups, focused on differences in lexicon and intonation.<a href="#ref13" id="13" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Our consultants also cite a set of supposed physical morphological differences in body size and skin color, as well as specific differences in the lengths of legs and fingers, and the diameter of upper arms and lower legs, as highly salient distinguishing features of the different sub-groups."><sup>13</sup></a> We refer to the linguistic variation indexing these sub-groups as ‘dialectal variation’.

*Table 12*. Iquito sub-groups

The identification of this dialectal variation is considerably complicated in the current day, however, by the fact that the 20th century saw the consolidation of Iquitos from all of these sub-groups into a small number of settlements, resulting in considerable dialect mixing. In addition, the current small total number of speakers exacerbates the difficulty of determining whether particular forms should be considered dialectal variants *per se*, by virtue of being historically associated with particular sub-groups; or whether they should be understood as sub-dialectal variants; or conversely, whether they participated historically in isoglosses spanning more than one dialect. In short, it is now challenging to understand how modern variation among a small number of individuals relates to historical forms of variation between, within, and across the dialect groups. We return to this point below.

A second source of variation in the Iquito lexical data are ongoing sound changes, the most striking being the loss of onsetless word-initial vowels.<a href="#ref14" id="14" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is worth noting that the same process affected Arabela, one of Iquito’s sister languages, such that all Arabela roots and affixes are now consonant-initial."><sup>14</sup></a> This process appears to be operating by lexical diffusion, so that some forms are unaffected, while other forms exhibit inter-speaker and/or intra-speaker variation in the presence of their initial vowels. (Others, we may assume, have by now entirely lost their initial vowels.)

These two sources of variation do not account for all variation in the data however, and at this point it becomes even more challenging to accurately characterize the basis of the variation. For example, if we compare certain forms produced by our two main male consultants, Hermenegildo Díaz Cuyasa (HDC) and Jaime Pacaya Inuma (JPI), with those produced by our main female consultant, Ema Llona Yareja (ELY), we find that the men’s forms exhibit certain types of sporadic and restricted vowel harmony. Significantly, the nature of this sporadic vowel harmony is often different between the two men. Similarly, a small but noticeable number of JPI’s forms exhibit /a/ where all other speakers exhibit /ɨ/ (e.g., *jaátaaraata* ~ *jɨɨ́taaraata*).

Since variability is a symptom of language obsolescence (Campbell & Muntzel 1989), it may be tempting to ascribe this and some other forms of lexical variation to the attrition of lexical knowledge. While this is no doubt a factor to some degree, many of the relevant variants are recognized by other speakers as stable over decades in the speech of particular individuals, and although idiosyncratic to a certain degree, this pattern is not clearly attributable to obsolescence-induced instability in lexical knowledge. In fact, consultants explain many cases of this smaller scale variation as due to the influence of a particular individual in their childhood, who used the forms in question. And in some cases, speakers attribute particular variants not to dialect groups, as discussed above, but to particular families. It seems clear, then, that there was some degree of systematic variation associated with families, and with particular individuals who may have been the last survivors of particular family lines.<a href="#ref15" id="15" data-toggle="tooltip" title="JPI’s grandmother Piírnaja, for example, who raised him after his mother died when JPI was a young child, seems to have been the last member of her Iíjakawɨɨ́raana family line, and she had significant influence on JPI’s language acquisition."><sup>15</sup></a> Family-group-based linguistic variation is not entirely surprising, given that the traditional Iquito settlement pattern was likewise family-group based, with such groups typically living several hours to several days of travel from their nearest neighbors. That family groups may have been a relevant unit of variation is also unsurprising given that the sociolinguistic and demographic circumstances of the late 19th century represent a massive collapse in terms of numbers and social organization in comparison to the state of Iquito society in the early 18th century, when Iquito people first came into contact with Europeans and mestizos through Jesuit missionary activity and their creation of *reducciones* in, and bordering on, Iquito territory. As such, it might be expected that family groups — which by the late 19th century were absorbed into one of the five sub-groups enumerated above — represented fragments of pre-contact Iquito linguistic diversity.

These observations regarding variation at the family-group and individual level suggest, first, that individual-level variation need not, and in most cases, should not, be ascribed to obsolescence-induced variability; and second, that a considerable fraction of individual-level variation in Iquito can never be accounted for in a fully satisfactory manner, resulting as it does from the virtually untraceable mixing of pre-contact linguistic diversity under circumstances of drastic demographic collapse and reorganization.

The classification of particular forms as dialectal or sociolinguistic variants of various types in this dictionary would ideally follow the methods of dialectology and sociolinguistics, both of which are empirically rigorous fields requiring the systematic, and relatively large-scale, collection of data within and across speech communities in order to arrive at trustworthy conclusions. Such work is, unfortunately, beyond our current abilities, in large part because language shift has already eroded the speech community to such a degree that the former dialectological and sociolinguistic structure of the Iquito speech communities would now be all but impossible to recover.

In place of sociolinguistic and dialectological surveys, we must instead rely on our consultants’ memories of the speech community in which they became adults, and their understanding of the dialectal and sociolinguistic organization of that community. This approach is a fraught one, of course, since it is well known that language ideologies exert powerful shaping effects on individuals’ perceptions of how particular linguistic forms are associated with particular socially salient groups, and how they are distributed within speech communities. With these caveats in place, we indicate below the linguistic variant categories that we employ in this dictionary, and the criteria we use to place forms in these categories.

**Named dialectal variants**

Iquito speakers recognize four major dialects, which correspond to the four major named Iquito sub-groups that survived into the early 20th century: *Iíjakawɨɨ́raana*, *Maasikuuri*, *Maájanakáani,* and *Naamuutújuri*. A fifth group, the *Aámuuwáaja*, which modern Iquito elders describe as a hunter-gatherer group, is considered to be closely related, but socially distinct from the Iquito groups. All these groups were identified with particular territories, given in Table 12, such that our consultants tend to alternate between identifying dialects with sub-group names or with their corresponding (former) geographical extent.

We identify a form as pertaining to a specific dialect if at least one of our consultants consistently identified a form as associated with that dialect. We take the Pintuyacu/*Iíjakawɨɨ́raana* dialect as the default dialect, and only indicate that a form is a dialectal variant if we identify it as pertaining to another dialect.

**Unnamed dialectal variants**

For some forms, speakers have clear judgments that they do not pertain to the Pintuyacu/*Iíjakawɨɨ́raana* dialect, but are instead associated with other Iquito dialect groups, yet they are unable to attribute the variant to any particular group.<a href="#ref16" id="16" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The phrase ‘Es de gente de otros ríos’, ‘It’s from people from other rivers’, is a common way that our consultants characterize such forms."><sup>16</sup></a> Such judgments potentially arise from two quite different situations. First, the variation in question may be a case where the Pintuyacu dialect was innovative (or borrowed an innovative form from another dialect), and the non-Pintuyacu dialect form was shared by more than one dialect. As such, it would be difficult to identify the non-Pintuyacu dialect form with a specific dialect. Second, the precise dialect group with which a non-Pintuyacu dialect form was associated may no longer be clear to our consultants. This is hardly surprising, since considerable dialect mixing dates back to at least the early 20th century, several decades prior to the birth of the elders with whom we work. We indicate that a variant is a ‘dialectal variant’, then, if consultants identified it as not pertaining to the Pintuyacu/*Iíjakawɨɨ́raana* dialect, but did not identify a specific dialect with which the form was associated.

**Sociolinguistic variants**

We reserve the term ‘sociolinguistic variant’ for variants that we ascribe to sound changes that appear to be in progress within the population of Iquito speakers, often exhibiting *intra*-speaker variation. The principal such sound change is the loss of short, toneless, word-initial vowels, a change that appears to be diffusing through the lexicon, and at this point mainly affects nouns. Different speakers produce particular alternants of specific alternant pairs with different frequencies, but we have made no attempt to quantify these frequencies.

**Named individual variants**

Named individual variants are variants in the dictionary that are ascribed to one of the co-authors who participated intensively in the preparation of the dictionary, namely Hermenegildo Díaz Cuyasa (HDC), Ema Llona Yareja (ELY), or Jaime Pacaya Inuma (JPI).<a href="#ref17" id="17" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Unfortunately, we have not included any specific variants for Ligia Inuma Inuma because she passed away before we began keeping track of individual variants."><sup>17</sup></a> These are variants that are uniformly used by that one identified speaker only, without any intra-speaker variation, and which moreover are not recognized by any of the speakers as a variant of wider use, either generally within the broader historical Iquito speech community, a regional dialect group, or a descent group. Moreover, these variants are generally recognized by all consultants as forms specifically and exclusively used by the particular speaker(s) to whom we ascribe the form.

Scientific names
----------------

Like other Amazonian languages, the part of the Iquito lexicon that is devoted to life forms is very rich, reflecting a profound accumulation of knowledge relating to the rainforest environment of the Iquito people. Most life forms or classes of life forms named in this significant reservoir of ethnobiological knowledge will be unfamiliar to many users of this dictionary, and reliance on their translational equivalents in local Spanish (if they exist) as the sole means of defining Iquito ethnobiological terms is problematic for a number of reasons (Michael & Jernigan, in prep.). For this reason, we have sought to provide scientific names for as many Iquito ethnobiological terms as possible, allowing readers to link Iquito ethnobiological terms to scientifically-recognized biological categories.

At the same time, we provide relevant local Spanish ethnobiological terminology in the definition of Iquito ethnobiological terms whenever possible, since these will be useful to users of the dictionary who seek to relate Iquito terms to ethnobiological terminology used in Loreto, and in Peruvian Amazonia more generally. Note, however, that some variation in Spanish ethnobiological terminology exists even within Loreto, let alone within the considerably greater region of Peruvian Amazonia as a whole. Appropriate caution should be taken, therefore, in the interpreting Spanish ethnobiological terminology given in this dictionary with respect to how these terms are used outside of Iquito territory. The information that we provide in the <a href="#section23">Loretano Spanish Glossary</a> will be helpful in this regard.

Linking Iquito ethnobiological terms with scientific nomenclature for species, genera, families, and other groupings of life forms has proceeded in two main ways. The first is direct identification of species by working with Iquito language specialists and using a set of converging methodologies, including visual identification using field guides, auditory identification using recordings of vocalizations, and the use of natural history descriptions for disambiguation.<a href="#ref18" id="18" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This methodology is described in detail in Michael & Jernigan (in prep.)."><sup>18</sup></a>

The second major methodology is to employ available works that relate local Spanish names to scientific names. In this respect we have been fortunate in that the nearby city of Iquitos has for many decades been a major base and staging area for zoological and botanical research in Amazonia. One consequence of this has been the publication of a large number of scientific works that provide local Spanish equivalents used in the Iquitos area for species discussed and identified in the works in question (see <a href="#section22">below</a>). By obtaining local Spanish equivalents to Iquito ethnobiological terms and then consulting works like these, we obtain important clues regarding the scientific names corresponding to Iquito ethnobiological terms. This has proved especially valuable in the case of Iquito ethnobiological terms for plants and fish, which have been more difficult for us to identify via more direct methods than mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians have.

It is important to emphasize that in general we do not rely exclusively on the associations given in these works between scientific names and local Spanish ethnobiological terminology in order to link Iquito ethnobiological terms to scientific ones. Whenever possible, we seek additional evidence made available by a candidate scientific identification (e.g., leaf shape, habitat type, or coloration) to confirm or reject the candidate identification. It is of course also the case that Iquito elders sometimes observe that no Spanish ethnobiological equivalent exists for a given Iquito term, or that the extension of the Spanish and Iquito terms are different, such that the utility of local Spanish equivalents is diminished in such cases.

Finally, we wish to observe that Iquito ethnobiological terms exhibit differing degrees of granularity with respect to scientific species names. Many correspond exactly to scientific species names, while others are more fine-grained, and others more coarse-grained. For names that are more fine-grained than scientific species names, we indicate that the Iquito term identifies a ‘variety’ of some specified scientific species. For names that are more coarse-grained than scientific species names, we indicate the Iquito term refers to a ‘type’ of life form, which we subsequently characterize by resort to genus or family names, e.g., we define *amariiki* as a general term for *zúngaro*-type fishes, which are large catfishes of the family *Pimelodidae*.

We conclude this section by listing the key works that we have consulted in developing the scientific name identifications found in this dictionary.

Loretano Spanish Glossary
-------------------------

In this section we provide a brief glossary of Loretano Spanish terms that are used in this dictionary. Although an effort has been made to avoid unfamiliar terms in crafting definitions, it has proved useful, for reasons of economy, to make sparing use of certain local Spanish terms for referents and concepts that are particular to the environmental and cultural contexts of northern Peruvian Amazonia. These terms are widely used in the variety of Spanish spoken throughout the *departamento* of Loreto, and in many cases, more widely through the rainforest regions of eastern Peru.

<tr>
<td><b>patrón</b></td>
<td>noun</td>
<td>A social role that became prominent in Peruvian Amazonia in the late 19th-century in the context of economic relations between Indigenous peoples and mestizos, particularly as part of the <i>patrón</i>–<i>peón</i> system. In this system, <i>patrones</i> maintained economic monopolies over geographical areas and over the Indigenous peoples living in them, sometimes using brutal force against the Indigenous people in question. <i>Patrones</i> traded manufactured goods, such as metal tools, soap, and clothing, with the Indigenous people over whom they had a monopoly, for forest products collected and processed by their Indigenous <i>peones</i>. The products in question depended on the economic vagaries of the market at various times, and what forest products were available, but the <i>patrón</i>–<i>peón</i> system was initially driven by efforts to extract natural rubber (<i>caucho</i>) from rainforest areas. On the basis of the monopoly they maintained, <i>patrones</i> traded at rates hugely disadvantageous to the Indigenous people with whom they worked.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>peón</b></td>
<td>noun</td>
<td>A person, typically an Indigenous person, working under a <i>patrón</i> (see above). <i>Peones</i> generally worked for manufactured goods, such as metal tools, soap, and clothing, and were often paid at rates that kept them more or less permanently in debt to the <i>patron</i> for whom they worked. This perpetual debt, combined with the fact that servitude to <i>patrones</i> was maintained through a combination of physical violence and coercion by government and church officials, led Iquito elders to refer to the time during which they worked as <i>peones</i> as <i>esclavitud</i>, ‘slavery’.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>pijuayo</b> (also <b>pifayo</b>)</td>
<td>noun</td>
<td><i>Bactris gasipaes</i> or Peach Palm, a palm traditionally of great importance to many Amazonian Indigenous peoples for both its wood and its oily, savory fruits, which can form an important part of the diet of Amazonian peoples during the months when they are in season. In Iquito territory, these somewhat ovoid fruits measure 5–8 cm diameter, and they have a dense and mealy flesh surrounding a small hard seed. The dark wood of the spine-covered trunk is especially tough, strong, and heavy, and traditionally served to make bows, spears, and other implements.</td>
</tr>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>restinga</b></td>
<td>noun</td>
<td>An area that is elevated with respect to the surrounding land and remains above the water level when the lower-lying area surrounding it floods during the wet season, turning it into an island.

</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>ripa</b></td>

<td>A lath of palm wood, which traditionally has two main uses. First, they are used as building material for walls, being placed vertically, one next to another, and tied to horizontal supports; for this use, the laths are generally 5–10cm in width and some 2m in length. Second, they serve as the item to which palm leaves are tied in the manufacture of <i>crisnejas</i>; for this use, they are generally 2–3cm in width, and 2–3m in length.</td>

<td><b>yuca</b></td>
<td>noun</td>
<td><i>Manihot esculenta</i>, also known in English as ‘manioc’ and ‘cassava’. It produces large carbohydrate-rich tubers and is one of the primary cultigens of Indigenous Amazonian peoples, as well as of settlers in the region. The tubers are cooked in a variety of ways for eating, as well as constituting the principal ingredient of <i>masato</i>. It merits mention that this word is often misspelled in English as <i>yucca</i>, a term that is instead properly applied to plants of the unrelated genus <i>Yucca</i>.</td>

Our greatest thanks go to our co-authors, the Iquito elders whose knowledge and expertise this dictionary seeks to reflect: Hermenegildo (Hermico) Díaz Cuyasa, Ligia Inuma Inuma, Ema Llona Yareja, and especially Jaime Pacaya Inuma. Over the course of hundreds (in Jaime’s case, thousands) of hours of collaborative work, these elders have conveyed to us the beauties and subtleties of the Iquito language, for the benefit of future generations of Iquito people, and to ensure that this patrimony of humanity is documented.

We also extend our thanks to the community members of San Antonio de Pintuyacu, whom we first visited in 2001, and where we have worked with the Iquito elders since 2002; the community’s interest in the products of our work with their elders has been a constant inspiration and motivation.

The current work drew considerably on an earlier Iquito–Spanish bilingual dictionary that we circulated among Iquito community members and online (Michael et al. 2006) and we sincerely thank our co-compiler on that work, Karina Sullón Acosta. That dictionary was much enriched by contributions of the members of the Iquito Language Documentation Project (ILDP) over the years, and we express our gratitude for their companionship and generously shared insights to Sisi Bautista Pizarro, Lynda (de Jong) Boudreault, Mark Brown, Taryne Hallett, Cynthia (Anderson) Hansen, Molly Harnisch, Edinson Huamancayo Curi, Marcelo Inuma Sinchija, I-Wen Lai, Kathryn Metz, Hilter Panduro Güimack, Rosalba Solís Vílchez, and Brianna (Grohmann) Walther.

Our work has been supported and facilitated by many other people. In particular, Nora England, at the University of Texas at Austin, made it possible to launch the ILDP as a long-term, multi-researcher project by joining us as PI on an Endangered Languages Documentation Programme grant (see below) while we were still graduate students, and she provided invaluable methodological and practical advice throughout the first phase of the ILDP.

Gabel Sotíl García, at the *Universidad Nacional de la Amazonía Peruana* in Iquitos, played a crucial role in the administration of the ILDP in its early years, and has been a source of valuable guidance and enthusiastic support for our community-oriented work. Gustavo Solís Fonseca and Elsa Vílchez Jiménez of the *Centro de Investigación de la Lingüística Aplicada* at the *Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos* (UNMSM) also provided essential support in the ILDP’s early years.

We also want to express our sincerest thanks to Joel Sherzer and Tony Woodbury for giving us unusual latitude while we were graduate students at UT–Austin, and allowing us to launch the ILDP in parallel with our dissertation projects, as well as for all of their advice, wisdom, and encouragement in all of our projects.

A print version of this dictionary (Michael et al. 2019, published by [Ediciones Abya-Yala](http://www.abyayala.org/) in Quito, Ecuador), upon which this searchable digital version is based, was made possible by Greg Finley and Ronald Sprouse, each of whom has played a pivotal role in the development of a Python script that converts the XML output of [Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx)](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/), which we used for developing this dictionary, to LaTeX, which we used to typeset it for print publication. Greg developed the early versions of the script; subsequently, Ronald has significantly expanded and fine-tuned the script to our evolving needs. We here wish to acknowledge and thank Ronald for his heroic labors in helping us bring this dictionary to fruition.

The work that resulted in this dictionary would have been impossible without the funding that we received from several sources. These include [Cabeceras Aid Project](http://www.cabeceras.org/), which has supported our community-oriented activities since 2001, and to whose board members and donors we express our infinite gratitude; the [Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Programme](https://www.eldp.net/), which supported documentation of Iquito from 2003 to 2006 with a Major Project grant (MDP-0042; co-PIs Nora England, Christine Beier and Lev Michael); and two NSF–NEH [Documenting Endangered Languages](https://www.neh.gov/grants/preservation/documenting-endangered-languages) Fellowships in 2015-2016 to Christine Beier (#230216-15) and Lev Michael (#230217-15).

Finally, we express our sincere thanks to all our other friends, family, and colleagues who have supported and encouraged our work on this project over these many years. We could not have gotten this far without you.

<a href="#6" id="ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It merits mention that although the official Ministry of Education alphabet is, as the description suggests, an alphabet and not an orthography *per se*, it is the case that the choice of letters for the official alphabet was significantly guided by an intention to produce an orthography very similar to the one used here. As far as we are aware, though, the Ministry of Education has yet to develop this orthography.

<a href="#7" id="ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Although some speakers do variably realize underlying /uka/ sequences as [uka]&sim;[ukʷa], this is an unrelated phenomenon.

<a href="#9" id="ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Interestingly, this was a common feature among orthographies developed by SIL missionaries for indigenous Peruvian Amazonian languages in the 1950s and 1960s. It is unclear, on a language by language basis, and in Iquito in particular, to what degree this choice represents a commitment to the underlying, or phonemic, representation of the speech sounds in question, and to what degree this was simply a general orthographic convenience.

<a href="#10" id="ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Indeed, in some cases, the irregular plural form is now considered archaic.

<a href="#11" id="ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Due to pragmatic competition with the other determiners, *iina, iimi* and *iipɨ* are often construed as speaker-proximal.

<a href="#12" id="ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> That is to say, frequent in the speech of these speakers when they are not closely monitoring their own speech for the use of loanwords. When these speakers are being especially vigilant, they tend to substitute either nonce Iquito neologisms or employ periphrasis to avoid the use of the loanword.

<a href="#13" id="ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Our consultants also cite a set of supposed physical morphological differences in body size and skin color, as well as specific differences in the lengths of legs and fingers, and the diameter of upper arms and lower legs, as highly salient distinguishing features of the different sub-groups.

<a href="#14" id="ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is worth noting that the same process affected Arabela, one of Iquito’s sister languages, such that all Arabela roots and affixes are now consonant-initial.

<a href="#15" id="ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> JPI’s grandmother Piírnaja, for example, who raised him after his mother died when JPI was a young child, seems to have been the last member of her *Iíjakawɨɨ́raana* family line, and she had significant influence on JPI’s language acquisition.

<a href="#16" id="ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The phrase *‘Es de gente de otros ríos’*, ‘It’s from people from other rivers’, is a common way that our consultants characterize such forms.

<a href="#17" id="ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Unfortunately, we have not included any specific variants for Ligia Inuma Inuma because she passed away before we began keeping track of individual variants.
